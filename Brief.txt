BRIEF
Our client is planning an event that is to be attended by 90 guests. These guests have beem seperated into two different groups, Standard and VIP.
The client has requested that we supply them with a report of all guests that have not yet registered in the system. 
They would like the report to group the guests by the guest group that they are assigned to (standard or vip) and would like both lists to be ordered alphabetically.
The client also requires that the guest names are formatted correctly as per the specification they have previously supplied us with. These specifications are already stored on the GuestGroup entity in our database.
Update this app to produce the report the client has requested. Output the report should be to the console.

NOTES
The database and data required for this task will be created when the app is run.
